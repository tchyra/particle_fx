                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p>
                    A fixed number of particles is generated on startup.
                    Their position is randomized within the bounds of the screen.
                    Each particle gets assigned a random size, which relates to the particle's mass.
                    In the snow effect, larger particles fell slower, here they fall faster.
                    However, larger particles are still affected by wind more than small ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every frame, each particle is updated first, then drawn.
                    Updating a particle consists of updating the X component of its velocity according to the current wind speed (more on wind later),
                    then updating its position based on its velocity and the amount of time that passed between frames.
                    This is to make the animation framerate-independent, meaning even if you run it on your newest gaming PC, it won't look sped up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rain particles are drawn as lines representing their position and their velocity.
                    The angle of the line is exactly the same as its velocity vector's angle.
                    The length of any given line is equal to that particle's velocity times a constant time.
                    Each particle also gets a colour randomly selected from a range of colours.

                <h2>Wind system</h2>
                <p>
                    There is a separate system in charge of updating the aforementioned wind speed that affects all particles.
                    It operates on cycles, each cycle comprising of two phases: a transition phase and a hold phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A cycle is started by assigning random values to both phase lengths,
                    assigning the new value the transition phase will transition to, and setting a timer variable to track how much time remains in each phase.
                    The timer is decremented on each frame. When it reaches zero, a check is made - if the current phase is the transition phase,
                    the timer is reset and the hold phase begins. Otherwise, a new cycle is started and the whole process repeats.
                </p>
