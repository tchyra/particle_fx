                <p>
                    This project is my own take on creating particle effects.
                    Some examples of particles include rain, snow, sand, electrons as well as atoms, confetti and volcano eruption debris, but gasses or fluids could also be approximated by particles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Particle effects are a computer simulation of particles aimed, usually, at making something look beliveable and/or nice.
                    They are mainly used in videogames and movies, to create sparks, magic effects, dust raising after a player runs across it, and many more similar effects.

                <p>
                    I use the HTML5 <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element to draw particles. Every particle effect uses two Javascript files, one of them is shared, while the other is specific to the effect.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The shared file is responsible for setting up things happening behind the scenes.
                    It initializes the canvas, requests animation frames to advance the animation and invokes functions defined in the second script.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second script is responsible for handling the specific particle effect it is meant to create. It handles particle creation, their interactions with the environment, updates their positions and draws frames. Any additional systems, for example a wind system for the rain and snow effects also go in this second file.
                </p>
